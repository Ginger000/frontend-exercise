Slenderly, languidly, their hands <a class="singlePost__link" href="">set lightly on their</a>  hips the two young women preceded us out
onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the

  "Why CANDLES?" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. "In two
weeks it'll be the longest day in the year." She looked at us all radiantly. "Do you always watch
for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year

"Civilization's going to pieces," broke out Tom violently. "I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist
about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"
<br><br>
"Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his tone.

          In June 1918 Fitzgerald was assigned to Camp Sheridan, near Montgomery, Alabama. There he
fell in love with a celebrated belle, eighteen-year-old Zelda Sayre, the youngest daughter of an
Alabama Supreme Court judge. The romance intensified Fitzgeraldâ€™s hopes for the success of his
novel, but after revision it was rejected by Scribners for a second time. The war ended just before
he was to be sent overseas;
